<br/>
Shows underlying correlation patterns between various research fields and researchers in major Universities of Japan in the form a graph networks. The projects deal with multi lingual data including English and Japanese. It was built on top of pretrained BERT model from HuggingFace and Facebookâ€™s FIASS indexing.<br/>

### Algorithm Implementations

[Upper Confidence Bound Implementation Fom Scratch](http://example.com/)<br/>
Based on the assumption that given a set of possible options each option has an underlying normal distribution, Upper Confidence Bound Strategy is coded from scratch to choose the optimal option without knowing those distribution, with minimal exploration, and maximum exploitation. This algorithm is useful in a wide variety of problems such as marketing, drug efficacy, and recommender systems.<br/>
